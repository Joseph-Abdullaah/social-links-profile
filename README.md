## My process

### Built with


* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox


### What I learned

This project helped reinforce my understanding of building responsive UI components using modern CSS. I also practiced customizing styles using CSS variables and implementing active states.

Example snippet:

```html
<a href="#">Github</a>
```

```css
a:active {
  background: var(--Green);
  color: var(--White);
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to explore accessibility enhancements and animation effects for link interactions in future projects. Also, Iâ€™d like to experiment with adding light/dark theme toggles.

### Useful resources
